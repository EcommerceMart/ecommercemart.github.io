## üí∞ 1. Lower Prices on Taobao

One of the top reasons shoppers choose **Taobao** is price. Since it's designed for the local Chinese market, prices are often:

- 10% to 50% lower than on AliExpress
- Less inflated due to global logistics and middlemen

**Example:**
A minimalist canvas tote bag might cost **¬•18 on Taobao (~$2.50)**, but the same product on AliExpress could be **$7‚Äì$10**.

Even after using an agent or forwarder, the total cost often remains cheaper.

- Affordable high-quality replicas of global brands

Many Taobao clothes never make it to AliExpress. It‚Äôs common for fashion influencers to buy directly from Taobao due to its **exclusive variety**.
