In 2025, **Shopify 1099k** reporting rules are undergoing a major change—and it could impact every online store owner in the United States. If you’re an ecommerce seller using platforms like Shopify, Etsy, PayPal, or eBay, you need to pay close attention. The IRS is cracking down on income reporting, and missing these updates could result in hefty penalties or tax complications.

This article explains what the changes are, why they matter, and what **Shopify sellers** must do to stay compliant.

## 🧾 What Is a 1099-K Form?

A **1099-K** is a tax form used by third-party payment processors (like Shopify Payments, Stripe, or PayPal) to report the gross amount of payments received by a seller over the course of a year. It's meant to help the IRS track business income and ensure proper taxation.

Prior to 2022, the federal reporting threshold was:
- **More than $20,000** in gross sales **and**
- **Over 200 transactions**

But that’s changing...

Beginning in **2025**, the IRS is enforcing a much **lower threshold**:

> **Only $600 in gross sales per year—regardless of the number of transactions.**

This means:
- Even casual sellers with minimal activity will now receive a 1099-K.
- You must report this income to the IRS.
- No more “side hustle secrecy.”

Shopify will issue a 1099-K to any U.S.-based seller who receives **$600 or more** in gross payments through Shopify Payments.

## 🤔 Why Is the IRS Doing This?

The change is part of the **American Rescue Plan Act** passed in 2021. The goal is to increase tax compliance, especially in the **gig economy and online commerce sectors**. The IRS believes that many small sellers are underreporting income.

So, what does this mean for your online store?
