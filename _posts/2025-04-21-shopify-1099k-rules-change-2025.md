## üßæ What Is a 1099-K Form?

A **1099-K** is a tax form used by third-party payment processors (like Shopify Payments, Stripe, or PayPal) to report the gross amount of payments received by a seller over the course of a year. It's meant to help the IRS track business income and ensure proper taxation.

Prior to 2022, the federal reporting threshold was:
- **More than $20,000** in gross sales **and**
- **Over 200 transactions**

But that‚Äôs changing...

Beginning in **2025**, the IRS is enforcing a much **lower threshold**:

> **Only $600 in gross sales per year‚Äîregardless of the number of transactions.**

This means:
- Even casual sellers with minimal activity will now receive a 1099-K.
- You must report this income to the IRS.
- No more ‚Äúside hustle secrecy.‚Äù

Shopify will issue a 1099-K to any U.S.-based seller who receives **$600 or more** in gross payments through Shopify Payments.

## ü§î Why Is the IRS Doing This?

The change is part of the **American Rescue Plan Act** passed in 2021. The goal is to increase tax compliance, especially in the **gig economy and online commerce sectors**. The IRS believes that many small sellers are underreporting income.

So, what does this mean for your online store?
