The Walmart credit card pre-approval process has become a trending topic among shoppers and credit seekers alike. 

Platforms like Reddit and Quora are filled with questions, reviews, and discussions about how it works, what improves approval chances, and the experiences of others. 

This article explores the entire process—from eligibility to application strategies—while pulling real-world insights from these platforms. 

Whether you're curious about the pre-approval email, the Synchrony Bank relationship, or building credit with Walmart, this guide will break it down in simple terms.

## Understanding Walmart Credit Card Pre-Approval

### What Is Pre-Approval?

Credit card pre-approval means a lender has determined you meet their initial criteria based on soft credit checks. This doesn’t guarantee final approval but indicates you're a strong candidate.

#### Pre-Approval vs Pre-Qualification

* **Pre-Approval**: Typically based on more detailed criteria. You might receive an email offer or see it when logged into Walmart’s website.
* **Pre-Qualification**: More informal, usually just checks basic financial and credit data.
