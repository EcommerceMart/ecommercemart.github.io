- English interface for Chinese sites
- Offers payment processing for international cards

## 🛡️ Is Pandabuy Safe to Use in 2025?
Let’s break it down into key categories that impact buyer safety:

### 1. **Payment Security**
Pandabuy accepts international credit/debit cards and services like PayPal (varies by region). Transactions are encrypted and processed through a secure gateway.

**Pro Tip:** Use a credit card with buyer protection for extra peace of mind.

### 2. **Account Protection**
Pandabuy uses standard login authentication methods and allows email verification. As of 2025, they are also rolling out two-factor authentication (2FA).

### 3. **Item Authenticity**
One of the main concerns for buyers is whether the item you ordered is genuine or matches the photos. Pandabuy has a built-in Quality Check (QC) process.

- **QC Photos:** You get photos of your item once it arrives at the warehouse
- **Customer Support:** You can raise concerns or ask for additional QC

### 4. **Shipping Reliability**
Once you're ready, you can ship items via different carriers (DHL, EMS, ePacket, etc.). You can even select packaging types (bubble wrap, shoe boxes, no branding).

### 5. **Customs and Import Duties**
Pandabuy provides customs declaration tools to help reduce taxes legally. However, you are still responsible for any import fees depending on your country’s laws.

### 6. **Return & Refund Policies**
Pandabuy has a return policy, but since it’s an agent service, the process can be tricky:
- Returns to Chinese sellers may not always be accepted
- Shipping return costs are paid by the buyer
- Refunds are usually issued to your Pandabuy account wallet
