## Challenges of Cross-Border Payments

### 1. Currency Conversion
Currency exchange rates and fees can significantly affect margins and customer satisfaction.

#### Solution:
Use gateways that offer real-time currency conversion with transparent rates, like PayPal and Stripe.

### 2. Regulatory Compliance
International laws differ by country, making compliance complex.

#### Solution:
Choose gateways that provide built-in compliance features, such as 3D Secure, KYC/AML tools, and GDPR adherence.

### 3. Local Payment Preferences
Credit cards may not be the preferred method everywhere. Customers want familiar options like iDEAL (Netherlands), Alipay (China), or Boleto (Brazil).

#### Solution:
Select gateways with a wide range of localized payment integrations.

### 4. Fraud Risk
Cross-border transactions often have higher fraud rates due to verification challenges.
