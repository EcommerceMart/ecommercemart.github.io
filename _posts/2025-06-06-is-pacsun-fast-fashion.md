## What Is Fast Fashion?

Fast fashion is a way of making clothes that focuses on speed and low cost. Brands like Shein, Zara, and H&M are famous for fast fashion. They make new styles quickly and sell them at low prices. This means you can buy trendy clothes without spending a lot of money.

Fast fashion brands copy styles from the runway or celebrities and make them available to everyone. They release new collections many times a year, sometimes every week. This is different from traditional fashion, which only releases new styles four times a year—one for each season.

Fast fashion is popular because it is cheap and trendy. But it can also cause problems. The clothes are not always made to last, and the people who make them are not always paid well. Fast fashion also creates a lot of waste because people throw away clothes quickly.
