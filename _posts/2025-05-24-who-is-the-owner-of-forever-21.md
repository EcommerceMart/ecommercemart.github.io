## Understanding Forever 21’s Legacy

### The Rise of a Fashion Giant

#### Origins in Los Angeles

Forever 21 was founded in 1984 by **Do Won Chang and Jin Sook Chang**, a Korean-American couple. Originally called Fashion 21, the store catered to the Los Angeles Korean-American community.

#### Expansion and Rebranding

By the 1990s, the brand rebranded to Forever 21 and aggressively expanded across the U.S. and globally. Known for its ultra-trendy, low-cost fashion, Forever 21 became a symbol of fast fashion's explosion.

#### Affordable Trends

Forever 21 thrived by offering affordable, quickly rotating fashion items. It targeted teens and young adults with a sharp eye for runway-inspired trends.

#### Global Footprint

At its peak, Forever 21 operated over 800 stores worldwide, including locations in the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and Latin America.

## Ownership Timeline: From Founders to Conglomerates

### Initial Ownership: Do Won and Jin Sook Chang

#### Family-Owned Business

Forever 21 remained privately owned by the Chang family for over 30 years. The couple maintained full control, avoiding public investment.

#### Challenges in Management

Despite early success, the company faced criticism for labor practices, rapid store openings, and overexpansion.

### Financial Trouble and Bankruptcy Filing

#### The 2019 Bankruptcy

In September 2019, Forever 21 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This shocked the retail world and signaled deeper problems in the fast fashion industry.

#### Reasons Behind the Bankruptcy

* Overexpansion with too many large-format stores
* Declining mall foot traffic
* Rise of e-commerce and fast competition
* Inefficient supply chain management

#### Role in Forever 21

ABG owns the intellectual property of Forever 21. It oversees global branding, marketing, and licensing.

### Simon Property Group

#### A Retail Real Estate Giant

Simon is the largest mall operator in the U.S. By acquiring Forever 21, it aimed to fill vacant mall space and support a retail anchor.
