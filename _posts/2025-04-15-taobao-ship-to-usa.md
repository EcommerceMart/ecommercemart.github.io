Yes, Taobao **does ship to the USA** — but not every seller does it directly.

### Two Main Shipping Methods:

1. **Direct Shipping**: Some sellers offer shipping straight to the U.S. via logistics companies (e.g., EMS, DHL, Cainiao).
2. **Consolidated Shipping via Forwarding Agents**: Most common method. You use a third-party warehouse in China that receives your items and ships them to the U.S.

Common forwarding services include:
- Taobao Global Consolidation and Shipping (官方集运)
- Superbuy
- Bhiner
