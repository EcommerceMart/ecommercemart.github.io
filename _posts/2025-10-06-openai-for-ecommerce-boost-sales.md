### 1. Personalized Product Recommendations  
Customers expect online stores to "know" them. OpenAI enables personalized recommendations by analyzing:  
- Purchase history  
- Browsing behavior

Instead of generic "best-sellers," OpenAI-driven systems deliver **relevant suggestions** that match the customer’s intent—boosting upselling and cross-selling opportunities.  

**Impact on sales**: Higher average order values and stronger customer loyalty.

### 2. Smarter AI Chatbots and Virtual Assistants  
Customer service can make or break an ecommerce store. OpenAI’s advanced conversational AI helps create chatbots that can:  
- Answer FAQs in natural language.  
- Recommend products during the conversation.  
- Handle refunds, cancellations, and complaints.  
- Provide 24/7 multilingual support.  

This reduces support costs while enhancing customer experience.  

**Example**: An AI chatbot that understands a customer asking, *“What’s the best running shoe for flat feet under $100?”* and responds with relevant options instantly.
