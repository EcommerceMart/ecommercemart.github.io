### Rapid Design Turnaround

Edikted uses trend forecasting and social media data to identify viral looks. These designs are often turned into physical products in under 3 weeks.

### Mass Production

Products are manufactured at scale, often in factories located in Southeast Asia and China. This allows Edikted to offer low prices while launching dozens of SKUs each season.

### Frequent New Arrivals

Edikted adds new items to its store every week, a hallmark of fast fashion turnover.

## Is Edikted Fast Fashion? Let’s Break It Down
