* H\&M
* Forever 21
* PrettyLittleThing
* Fashion Nova

Let’s see if Edikted fits these characteristics.

### Rapid Design Turnaround

Edikted uses trend forecasting and social media data to identify viral looks. These designs are often turned into physical products in under 3 weeks.

### Mass Production

Products are manufactured at scale, often in factories located in Southeast Asia and China. This allows Edikted to offer low prices while launching dozens of SKUs each season.

### Frequent New Arrivals

Edikted adds new items to its store every week, a hallmark of fast fashion turnover.

## Is Edikted Fast Fashion? Let’s Break It Down

### 1. **Production Speed**

* New collections drop almost every week.
* Edikted heavily follows micro-trends from social media.
* High volume production cycles prioritize speed over craftsmanship.

**Verdict:** Matches fast fashion behavior.

### 2. **Price Points**

* Most tops, dresses, and pants cost between \$15 and \$40.
* Flash sales, discounts, and coupon codes are common.

**Verdict:** Fast fashion pricing.

### 3. **Material Quality and Longevity**

* Reviews suggest thin fabrics, polyester blends, and basic stitching.
* Not built for long-term use or frequent washing.

**Verdict:** Budget construction typical of fast fashion.

### 4. **Sourcing and Transparency**

* No public information on where materials are sourced
* No detailed supplier or worker welfare disclosures

**Verdict:** Lacks the transparency of a sustainable brand.
