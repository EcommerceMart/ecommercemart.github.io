**Taobao’s shipping to Canada involves several steps:**

- **Domestic Shipping in China:** After you place an order, the seller ships your item to a warehouse in China. This step typically takes 3–7 days, depending on the seller’s location and the efficiency of domestic couriers.
- **International Shipping:** Once your items reach the warehouse, they are consolidated (if you have multiple orders) and shipped internationally to Canada. This is the most variable part of the process and depends on the shipping method you choose.
- **Customs Clearance in Canada:** Your package must clear Canadian customs before it is handed over to a local courier for final delivery. Customs processing times can vary, especially during peak seasons.
