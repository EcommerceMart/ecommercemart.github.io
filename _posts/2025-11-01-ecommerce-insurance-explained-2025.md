## What Is E-Commerce Insurance?

* **Cyber Liability Insurance:** Covers financial losses from hacking, data breaches, or cyber fraud.

## Why E-Commerce Insurance Is Essential in 2025

### 1. Rising Cybersecurity Threats

Cybercrime costs are projected to exceed **$10.5 trillion annually by 2025**. Small and mid-sized e-commerce stores are frequent targets because they often lack robust security systems.

### 2. Product Liability Is a Growing Risk

Even if you source products from trusted suppliers, a defect or safety issue can trigger expensive lawsuits. Whether you sell electronics, beauty products, or apparel, **product liability insurance** protects you from customer injury or property damage claims.

### 3. Marketplace Requirements

Major platforms like **Amazon**, **Etsy**, and **Walmart Marketplace** now **require sellers to carry liability insurance** once they cross specific sales thresholds. Not having valid insurance can result in account suspension or permanent delisting.

### 4. Shipping and Logistics Issues

Lost or damaged goods, delivery delays, or supply chain disruptions can impact customer satisfaction and profit margins. Insurance coverage for **transit and inventory** ensures financial stability during unforeseen logistics failures.

### 5. Regulatory Compliance

As governments tighten consumer protection laws, **insurance is becoming part of compliance requirements** for online sellers, especially those operating internationally.
