### Evaluating Clothing Quality

To understand if Boohoo is good quality, we first need to define what “quality” means in clothing:

#### h4: Key Indicators of Quality:

* **Fabric type**: Cotton, polyester, viscose, blends
* **Durability**: Will it last through multiple wears and washes?
* **Fit and sizing**: Accurate measurements and design
* **Stitching and finish**: Clean seams and strong construction
* **Color retention**: Does it fade quickly?
* **Value for money**: Does the cost match the performance?

## Materials and Fabrics Used by Boohoo

### Fabric Composition

Most Boohoo clothing is made from the following materials:

* **Polyester**: Widely used for affordability
* **Elastane**: For stretch in bodycon and fitted pieces
* **Cotton blends**: Used in casual wear and basics
* **Viscose**: Found in dresses and tops

### Is Polyester a Problem?

Polyester is cost-effective and wrinkle-resistant, but:

* It may feel less breathable than natural fabrics
* Can trap heat and sweat
* Not the most eco-friendly option

### Customer Insight on Fabric Feel

Many customers report that Boohoo’s clothing **feels thinner** than expected. Stretchy materials are comfortable but not always durable.
