## Is Momanda a Fast Fashion Brand?

While Momanda does produce trend-driven styles, it focuses on a narrow, functional niche (maternity/postpartum). Unlike Shein or Forever 21:

* It doesn’t add hundreds of products weekly
* Sizing is more consistent
* Reviews reflect customer satisfaction over volume

So while it may borrow fast fashion’s pricing model, its product lifecycle and target audience are much more stable and intentional.
