This guide breaks down exactly how Shopify Capital works, its benefits, eligibility criteria, repayment process, and how it compares to traditional loans. By the end, you’ll understand whether Shopify Capital is the right funding solution for your ecommerce store.

## What Is Shopify Capital?

Shopify Capital is Shopify’s own business funding program designed to help ecommerce merchants access working capital quickly and efficiently. Launched in 2016, the program allows eligible store owners to receive cash advances or loans based on their store’s sales performance.

Unlike traditional business loans that require lengthy applications, credit checks, and financial statements, Shopify Capital uses your store’s sales data to determine eligibility and offer amount. This means funding decisions are made faster and with less paperwork.

### Key Highlights

* **No credit checks:** Shopify bases approval on store performance, not personal credit history.
* **Fast funding:** Eligible merchants can receive funds within days.
* **Automated repayment:** Repayment is deducted automatically as a percentage of daily sales.
* **Flexible use:** Funds can be used for inventory, ads, new hires, or product expansion.

## How Shopify Capital Works

Shopify Capital operates on a simple model: Shopify reviews your store’s performance, offers a funding amount, and automatically deducts repayments as you make sales. Let’s break this process down step by step.

### Step 1: Eligibility and Offer

Shopify uses its internal analytics to determine if your store qualifies for funding. Factors include:

* Average monthly sales volume
* Shopify Payments history
* Store performance and stability
* Shopify plan type

<!-- <ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-2784742237479601"
     data-ad-slot="3760872290"
     data-ad-format="auto"
     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script> -->

If your store qualifies, Shopify will notify you directly in your dashboard with one or more funding offers. These offers show the amount you can borrow, the total owed (including fees), and the percentage of future sales that will go toward repayment.

### Step 2: Choosing an Offer

You can choose from several pre-approved offers. Each offer varies in terms of:

* **Funding amount** — how much capital you’ll receive.
* **Total repayment** — the total amount you’ll repay (includes fixed fee).
* **Remittance rate** — the percentage of your daily sales that go toward repayment.

### Step 3: Receiving Funds

Once you accept an offer, Shopify transfers the funds directly to your bank account — usually within two to three business days.

### Step 4: Repayment

Repayment happens automatically through a small percentage of your daily sales. If you have a slow day or no sales, no payment is deducted. This structure makes Shopify Capital more flexible than traditional loan systems.

## Types of Shopify Capital Funding

Shopify offers two main types of funding: **Merchant Cash Advance (MCA)** and **Shopify Loan**.

### 1. Merchant Cash Advance

With a **Merchant Cash Advance**, Shopify provides a lump sum upfront in exchange for a fixed repayment amount. Instead of monthly payments, Shopify deducts a percentage of your daily sales until the total owed is fully repaid.

**Example:**
If Shopify advances you $10,000, and the total repayment is $11,300 with a 10% daily remittance rate, you’ll repay through small daily deductions from sales until $11,300 is fully paid.

<!-- <ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-2784742237479601"
     data-ad-slot="3760872290"
     data-ad-format="auto"
     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script> -->

**Best for:** Stores with fluctuating sales volumes that prefer flexibility in repayments.

### 2. Shopify Loan

A **Shopify Loan** functions more like a traditional installment loan. You receive a fixed amount of money upfront and repay it in regular installments over a set period.

**Best for:** Stores with predictable sales and stable income who want structured repayments.

## Benefits of Shopify Capital

Shopify Capital offers several advantages for online entrepreneurs who want fast, flexible funding without traditional bank requirements.

### 1. Quick Access to Funds

Shopify uses your store’s data to make instant lending decisions. You can receive funds within days, unlike banks that may take weeks.

### 2. No Hard Credit Checks

Your credit score doesn’t affect your eligibility. Shopify looks at your store’s actual performance — making it accessible for newer or small businesses.

### 3. Automatic Repayment

Repayments are handled automatically from your daily sales. You don’t need to worry about missed payments or scheduling.

### 4. Flexibility in Use

There are no restrictions on how to use Shopify Capital. You can invest in:

* Inventory expansion

* Launching new products
* Redesigning your store

## Shopify Capital vs Traditional Business Loans

| Feature              | Shopify Capital     | Traditional Bank Loan  |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Approval Speed**   | 1–3 days            | 2–4 weeks              |
| **Credit Check**     | Not required        | Required               |

## Who Is Eligible for Shopify Capital?

Eligibility isn’t open to all Shopify users — it’s based on several internal criteria that Shopify doesn’t publicly disclose. However, typical requirements include:

* Your store uses **Shopify Payments**.
* Your store has been active for several months (usually 3+ months).
* Consistent sales performance.
* A good track record with Shopify’s policies.

If you’re eligible, Shopify will proactively offer you funding options — you can’t apply directly.

---

## How Repayment Works

Shopify automatically deducts a small, agreed-upon percentage from your daily sales until you’ve repaid the total owed.

<!-- <ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-2784742237479601"
     data-ad-slot="3760872290"
     data-ad-format="auto"
     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script> -->

### Example of Repayment Calculation

If you borrow **$20,000** and owe **$23,000** (including fees) with a **10% remittance rate**, Shopify will deduct **10% of your daily sales** until $23,000 is repaid.

If your store makes $1,000 in a day, Shopify deducts $100. On slow days, you pay less.

### Key Advantage:

No fixed due dates — payments scale with your performance.

## Common Misconceptions About Shopify Capital

### 1. “It’s Free Money”

Shopify Capital is a business funding tool — not a grant. You must repay the full amount with fees.

### 2. “It Affects My Credit Score”

It doesn’t impact your personal credit since Shopify doesn’t perform hard credit inquiries.

### 3. “All Shopify Stores Qualify”

Eligibility is selective and data-driven. New stores with low sales may not receive offers immediately.

### 4. “You Can Reapply Anytime”

You can only receive new funding once your existing balance is nearly repaid.
