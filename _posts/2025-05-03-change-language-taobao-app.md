## Understanding Taobao’s Language Settings in 2025

### Limited Native Language Options

As of 2025, Taobao still does not provide full native English support within the mobile app. The default language remains Simplified Chinese.

### Why It Matters

For international users, navigating an app in Chinese can lead to misunderstandings in product descriptions, payment steps, and delivery information.
