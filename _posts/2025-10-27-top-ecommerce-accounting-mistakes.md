* Increases the risk of IRS red flags.

### How to Avoid It

## 3. Poor Cash Flow Management

Even profitable ecommerce stores can run into trouble without proper cash flow planning. Many entrepreneurs mistake sales growth for financial stability.

### How to Avoid It

* Forecast cash flow monthly using software like **Float** or **Futrli**.

## 4. Not Reconciling Accounts Regularly

Skipping monthly reconciliations can cause small errors to compound into large financial inaccuracies.

### Why It’s a Problem

* Overstocking or discounting at a loss.

### How to Avoid It

## 9. Ignoring Financial Reports and KPIs

Many entrepreneurs skip reviewing their financial statements, missing key insights that drive better decisions.

### Why It’s a Problem
