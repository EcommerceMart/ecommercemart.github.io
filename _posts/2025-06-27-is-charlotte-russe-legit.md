Charlotte Russe is a fashion retail brand that primarily targets women and teen girls with budget-friendly clothing, shoes, and accessories.

It was later acquired by YM Inc., a Canadian fashion retailer, and relaunched its website and select retail locations.

## Why Are People Asking “Is Charlotte Russe Legit?”

Before purchasing from any online fashion retailer, especially one with a turbulent business history, it’s wise to assess whether it’s trustworthy. The keyword phrase *is Charlotte Russe legit* commonly arises due to:

- Its 2019 bankruptcy filing
- Concerns over order fulfillment and product quality
- Mixed customer reviews on platforms like Trustpilot, Sitejabber, and Reddit
- Changes in ownership and business model
- Questions about returns and refunds

Let’s dive deep into each area to provide clarity.

## Company Background and Ownership

### The Rise and Fall of Charlotte Russe

Charlotte Russe was originally founded in San Diego, California. By the mid-2010s, it operated over 500 stores nationwide. However, increased competition from fast fashion giants like Fashion Nova, Shein, and Forever 21 contributed to financial losses. In early 2019, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and closed all stores.

### The Relaunch Under YM Inc.

YM Inc., a Canadian-based retail group that owns multiple fashion chains (such as Urban Planet and Suzy Shier), acquired Charlotte Russe’s assets. By late 2019, Charlotte Russe resumed operations under the new ownership, starting with an online storefront and gradually re-opening physical locations.

This ownership shift has led to a restructured business model, streamlined collections, and a focus on e-commerce growth.
