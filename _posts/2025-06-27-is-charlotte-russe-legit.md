## What Is Charlotte Russe?

Charlotte Russe is a fashion retail brand that primarily targets women and teen girls with budget-friendly clothing, shoes, and accessories. Known for trendy pieces inspired by runway looks, Charlotte Russe offers a wide selection of dresses, tops, jeans, activewear, and more—often at highly discounted prices.

The brand originally launched in 1975 and grew rapidly across the United States, with physical stores in nearly every major mall.

It was later acquired by YM Inc., a Canadian fashion retailer, and relaunched its website and select retail locations.

### The Rise and Fall of Charlotte Russe

Charlotte Russe was originally founded in San Diego, California. By the mid-2010s, it operated over 500 stores nationwide. However, increased competition from fast fashion giants like Fashion Nova, Shein, and Forever 21 contributed to financial losses. In early 2019, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and closed all stores.

### The Relaunch Under YM Inc.

YM Inc., a Canadian-based retail group that owns multiple fashion chains (such as Urban Planet and Suzy Shier), acquired Charlotte Russe’s assets. By late 2019, Charlotte Russe resumed operations under the new ownership, starting with an online storefront and gradually re-opening physical locations.

This ownership shift has led to a restructured business model, streamlined collections, and a focus on e-commerce growth.
