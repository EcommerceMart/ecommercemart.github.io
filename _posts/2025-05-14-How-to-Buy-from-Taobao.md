### Language Barrier

Taobao is primarily in Chinese with limited English support, making it hard for non-Mandarin speakers to search, communicate, or understand product details.

### Payment Methods

Taobao only supports Chinese payment methods like Alipay and domestic credit cards, which are not accessible to most international users.

### Shipping Limitations

Direct international shipping is not available on many items, requiring the use of forwarding services.

## Three Main Ways to Buy from Taobao Internationally

### 1. Use a Taobao Agent

#### What Is a Taobao Agent?

Agents act as middlemen: they purchase the item on your behalf, receive it in China, and ship it to your international address.

#### Popular Agents

### 3. Buy Direct Using a Freight Forwarder

#### What Is a Freight Forwarder?

You purchase items directly on Taobao, ship them to a Chinese warehouse, and the forwarder ships them internationally.

#### Example Services

* 4PX
* ZTO
* SF Express

#### Required Skills

* Basic Mandarin or browser translation tools
