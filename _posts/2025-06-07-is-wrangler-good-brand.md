## Is Wrangler a Good Brand? Key Factors to Consider

### 1. Quality of Wrangler Products

#### Jeans and Apparel Durability

Wrangler built its name on tough, long-lasting jeans. However, many recent buyers have reported issues with durability. Some customers say that the quality of denim has declined, with jeans ripping or wearing out faster than expected. Others mention problems like thin fabric, poor stitching, and belt loops tearing off easily.

> “Every pair of Wrangler jeans I've purchased in last 10 years has had the belt loops on each side of the middle simply rip off... I found the solution: I'm not buying anything Wrangler any more!”

#### Fit and Comfort

Fit is a big concern for many Wrangler shoppers. Some reviews state that Wrangler’s sizing has become inconsistent, with jeans running smaller or larger than expected. This can make online shopping risky, as you may need to return or exchange items that don’t fit.

#### Materials Used

Wrangler uses a mix of regular and organic cotton in its products. The brand has started to include lower-impact materials like organic cotton, which is a positive step for sustainability.

### 2. Customer Service and Shopping Experience

</script> -->

#### Online Shopping

Many customers report negative experiences with Wrangler’s online store. Common complaints include:

- Slow shipping or lost packages
- Difficulties with returns and refunds
- Poor communication from customer service

> “I waited a month for this package just for it to say delivered at 4:30am and yet I have received nothing... upon emailing and texting off their website I have gotten NO help”.

#### Returns and Refunds

Wrangler charges return fees, and some customers say it takes weeks to process refunds. This can be frustrating if you receive the wrong size or a defective product.

### 3. Value for Money

Wrangler is known for affordable prices, especially compared to premium denim brands. If you’re looking for budget-friendly jeans or western wear, Wrangler offers competitive pricing. However, you may be trading off some quality and customer service for the lower cost.

### 4. Sustainability and Ethics

Wrangler is making progress in sustainability by using some organic cotton and focusing on reducing its environmental impact. However, the brand still has room to improve in areas like workers’ rights and animal welfare.

- **Planet rating:** “Good” (uses some lower-impact materials)
- **People rating:** “Not Good Enough” (needs better worker policies)
- **Animals rating:** “It’s a Start” (some animal welfare policies)

### 5. Brand Reputation and Customer Reviews

While Wrangler has a long history and is trusted by many for its classic styles, recent customer feedback is mixed. The brand has a low rating (1.3 stars out of 5) on some review sites, mainly due to quality and customer service issues.
