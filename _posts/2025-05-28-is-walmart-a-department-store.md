## Historical Context of Walmart’s Growth

Instead, Walmart is best classified as a **big-box discount retailer** or **hypermarket**, depending on the specific store format. It operates on a vastly different business model aimed at scale, affordability, and efficiency.

Understanding this distinction helps consumers, students, and retail enthusiasts better navigate the modern shopping landscape and the evolution of retail giants like Walmart.
