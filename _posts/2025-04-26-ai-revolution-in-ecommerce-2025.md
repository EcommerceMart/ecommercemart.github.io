## What Is AI in Ecommerce?
AI in ecommerce refers to the use of artificial intelligence technologies — such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and deep learning — to automate, optimize, and enhance various aspects of the ecommerce experience.

It touches everything from the customer’s first click on a product to the final delivery — and even beyond, into returns and loyalty programs. Think smarter search functions, automated customer service, hyper-personalized marketing campaigns, and more.
