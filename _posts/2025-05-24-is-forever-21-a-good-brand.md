## The Rise and Fall—and Rise Again—of Forever 21

### The Brand's Origins

Forever 21 was founded in 1984 in Los Angeles. It quickly became known for trendy, affordable fashion targeting teens and young adults. The brand's fast inventory turnover kept shelves fresh with new styles, attracting fashion-conscious bargain hunters.

### Bankruptcy and Rebirth

In 2019, Forever 21 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The move signaled trouble amid a shifting retail landscape. However, the brand made a comeback under new ownership, aiming to modernize its strategy and focus more on e-commerce.

### Material Choices and Durability

Forever 21 uses a variety of synthetic materials and cotton blends. While prices are low, this often means the garments are not made to last beyond a season or two.

#### Pros:

* Affordable prices
* Wide selection of on-trend items

#### Cons:

* Inconsistent sizing
* Fast fashion durability

### Customer Reviews and Ratings

Online reviews on platforms like Trustpilot and Sitejabber show a mixed bag. While some praise the affordability, others express concerns about shrinking clothes, tearing seams, and lack of longevity.

## Is Forever 21 Ethical or Sustainable?

### Labor Practices and Supply Chain Transparency

Forever 21 has faced criticism in the past for poor labor practices and lack of supply chain transparency. In 2025, the brand has made small improvements but still falls short compared to ethical fashion leaders.

### Environmental Concerns

Most of Forever 21’s inventory is still manufactured using environmentally taxing processes. Unlike brands with circular fashion models, Forever 21 rarely offers recycling programs or biodegradable packaging.
