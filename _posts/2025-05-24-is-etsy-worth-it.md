## Etsy vs Other Marketplaces

### Etsy vs Shopify

**Shopify** offers full control over branding, but it requires:

* Website management
* Driving your own traffic
* Monthly subscription fees (starting at \$39/month)

**Etsy**, by contrast:

* Is easier to start
* Offers built-in traffic
* Charges based on sales rather than monthly fees

### Etsy vs Amazon Handmade

Amazon Handmade offers vast reach but:

* Has a rigorous approval process
* Takes longer to set up
* Has higher competition with larger brands

Etsy offers more community feel and is simpler to start with.

### Etsy vs eBay

Etsy is niche-specific and attracts a particular buyer demographic. eBay is more general and is often used for resale and auctions.

### Case Study 2: Handmade Jewelry

“I make handcrafted silver rings. Etsy’s fees have increased, but the buyer trust is worth it. I experimented with Shopify but didn’t get the same traffic.”
