### Allowed

* **One do-follow link** to your primary site or portfolio (must be directly relevant to the article)
* **Up to two additional links** to high-authority reference sources (industry reports, platform docs)
* Natural keyword usage—write for readers first, search engines second

### Not Allowed

* Spammy, irrelevant, or doorway links
* Affiliate-only pages or links that exist purely to convert clicks
* Links to adult, gambling, illegal, or shady finance products

Anchor text should be natural and reader-focused (e.g., “Shopify checkout tips” not “buy now cheap app”).
